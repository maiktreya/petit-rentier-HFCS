Country specific notes	
    
Austria	
AT1  Saving accounts include building savings and savings in life insurance contracts due to its common use as a savings vehicle and the data collection at the household level. Values of life insurance contracts are calculated based on the information on starting time and length of the contract, contribution to the life insurance and periodicity of the contribution.	
AT2  Every farmer is treated as having a self-employed business. In case the farmer could not separate the values of the household’s main residence from the value of the farm the value was split during the imputation procedure according to similar farmers who gave separated values. The total of self-employed business and household main residence was not changed by the procedure but only the share going towards each category was imputed. If the farmer also reported other real estate asset used for business purposes additional to the amount he puts into his farming business asset, this asset is added to his farming business asset.	
AT3  If respondents were not able to provide gross amounts, net information was collected for employee income, self-employment income, pension income, and income from financial assets, and converted to gross amounts using information on the employment status, household structure, geographical location, the tax code and the flat capital income tax of 25.

IT1  In Wave 4, the sample design of the survey has been modified to improve the statistical coverage of indebted households and high-income households. As a result the estimates are not directly comparable with the ones reported in the statistical tables of previous waves.	
IT2  Income is always collected net of taxes and social contributions. Gross incomes are reconstructed using a methodology developed on the basis of information on personal income tax and social contributions at national level and on the basis of the demographic characteristics of the household members.	
IT3  Liabilities are collected by the purpose of the loan, not by collateral. The information on the type of collateral used is collected, but it is possible that more than one type of collateral is used for the same debt and the amount of loan can be higher than the value of property indicated as collateral.

Luxembourg	
LU1  The pension section of the survey questionnaire is country specific and did not follow the HFCS core questionnaire.	
Latvia	
LV1  Register data were used to edit wage, self-employed and pension data at the personal level, including cases if respondent could not provide either gross or net amount.	
"LV2  Register data were used to edit data on real estate properties. Register data could be merged with HFCS data at the personal level.

Netherlands	
NL1  The first two waves of the HFCS were based on smaller samples (ca. 1,200 households) than in 2017 and 2021 and information on assets and liabilities was derived from existing Dutch surveys. The most recent waves used a sample of ca. 2,500 households and followed the wording of the HFCN questionnaire exactly. Therefore, the previous two waves may show more sampling uncertainty, and differences in the wording may also have influenced the outcomes. Overall, the data from the 2017 and 2021 waves are better aligned with the data on household wealth published by Statistics Netherlands.	
Portugal	
PT1  Net income was collected, if gross income was not known by the respondent. When that occurred, gross income was estimated using a specific microsimulation model following the national EU-SILC survey methodology.
