"NL1  Compared to the data from wave 2017, the data from waves 2010 and 2014 (waves 1 and 2) are based on smaller samples (ca. 1200 households) and information about assets and liabilities is derived from existing Dutch surveys. Instead, the data from wave 2017 are based
on a larger sample (ca. 2500 households) and exactly follows the wording of the HFCN questionnaire. Therefore, the waves 2010 and 2014 may show more sampling uncertainty and differences in the exact wording may have influenced the outcomes as well. Overall, the 2017 wave
