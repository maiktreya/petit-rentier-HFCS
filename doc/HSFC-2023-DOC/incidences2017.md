Country specific notes

Austria
AT1  Saving accounts include life insurance contracts due to its common use as a savings vehicle and the data collection at the household level. Values of life insurance contracts are calculated based on the information on starting time and length of the contract, contribution to the life insurance and periodicity of the contribution.
AT2  Every farmer is treated as having a self-employed business. In case the farmer could not separate the values of the household’s main residence from the value of the farm the value was split during the imputation procedure according to similar farmers who gave separated values. The total of self-employed business and household main residence was not changed by the procedure but only the share going towards each category was imputed. If the farmer also reported other real estate asset used for business purposes additional to the amount he puts into his farming business asset, this asset is added to his farming business asset.
AT3  If respondents were not able to provide gross amounts, net information was collected for employee income, self-employment income, pension income, and income from financial assets, and converted to gross amounts using information on the employment status, household structure, geographical location, the tax code and the flat capital income tax of 25.
Belgium
BE1  If respondents were not able to provide gross amounts, net income was collected for employee, self-employment and pension income and gross amounts estimated.
BE2  Financial assets have been imputed as a whole and not each item separately.
Germany
DE1  The respondent was able to choose whether to provide the income figure gross or net. Net income amounts were converted to gross amounts.
DE2  The variable on income from private business other than self-employment was not fully imputed
Estonia
EE1  Information on credit card and credit line/overdraft debt is mostly based on register data.
EE2  Information on pension wealth is mostly based on register data.
EE3  Information on most financial assets is a mix of register and interview data.
EE4  Information on non-collateralised loans and leasing is based on register data.
EE5  Register data is used for editing variables on mortgages.
EE6  Unemployment benefits were collected from registers. Information on public transfers and pension income is a mix of register and interview data. Register data on employee and self-employment income is used for data editing.

Spain
ES1  The variable value of the other assets (HD1920) was not fully collected.

ES4  The variable re-applying for credit (HC1320) was not collected.
ES5  The questions on credit constraints (HC1310a,HC1310b) reflects loan rejections and applications during the last two years.  Moreover, the variable (HC1400) was not collected if the household was granted a loan during the last two years. Therefore, the figure on credit-constrained households is likely to be a downward estimate
ES6  Information on the remaining value of pension funds currently received as payments is not collected.
Finland
FI1  Housing and real wealth variables are mostly based on register data or register-based estimation. The value of HMR was estimated using administrative data on dwellings and sales price data.

FI9  Individual private voluntary pensions are estimated from register data, values of whole life insurance are based on survey responses.
FI10 Except for food outside home, consumption variables are to a large extent statistically matched from the Household Budget Survey (HBS).
France
FR1  Information on HMR and other real estate mortgages covers loans that either have a mortgage on the property or are related to the property purchase and have a mortgage, a registration in lender's privilege, or a collateral provided by either "Crédit Logement", other guarantee company, a mutual insurance company, a private individual, a financial guaranty, or another type of guarantee.
FR2  Income data are obtained from administrative data sources. Income is defined as gross of income taxes and net of social contributions.
FR3  Information on private loans was not collected separately, but is included in non-collateralised loans.
FR4  The variable on income from private business other than self-employment was not collected
FR5  The variable on income from other sources was not collected.
FR6  The third wave of the French wealth survey is the first wave of re-interrogation. In the replicate weights, the new panel component could not be taken into account properly. Furthermore, the replicate weights have not been calibrated to the original margins. The standard errors may appear as too large.
Greece
GR1  For employee, self-employment and pension income respondents can report net or gross income, as well as monthly or annual. Net monthly and net annual amounts the amounts are converted to gross by adding the estimated social contributions and the estimated applicable tax. Monthly income is converted to annual based on the number of months this income has been received.
GR2  Savings accounts are collected in two separate questions, one for savings accounts and one for time deposits plus certificates of deposits.
GR3  Outstanding credit cards balance can be reported separately for each credit card.
Croatia
HR1  Income variables were asked to be expressed as gross, but respondents could report net of income, in which case the figures were grossed-up by the model created by the Central Bank.
Hungary
HU1  If respondents were not able to provide gross amounts, net income was collected and converted to gross amounts.
HU2  Variables on 'household was denied credit' and 'households re-applying for credit' were not collected.
HU3  Variables on other property mortgages were not fully imputed
HU4  Variables on the value of self-employment businesses were not fully imputed
Italy
IT1  Income is always collected net of taxes and social contributions. Gross incomes are reconstructed using a methodology developed on the basis of information on personal income tax and social contributions at national level and on the basis of the demographic characteristics of the household members.
IT2  Liabilities are collected by the purpose of the loan, not by collateral. The information on the type of collateral used is collected, but it is possible that more than one type of collateral is used for the same debt and the amount of loan can be higher than the value of property indicated as collateral.
IT3  Income from financial assets is not directly collected, but it is estimated using the information on owned financial assets and average interest rates. Furthermore, the methodology for the estimation of net/gross income from financial assets has been revised with respect to previous waves.
IT4  The variable on income from private business other than self-employment was not collected
Lithuania
LT1  Information on households' liabilities is based on registers
LT2  The variable on income from financial investments was not fully imputed.
Latvia
LV1  Register data were used to edit wage, self-employed and pension data at the personal level, including cases if respondent could not provide either gross or net amount.
"LV2  Register data were used to edit data on real estate properties. Register data could be merged with HFCS data at the personal level.

The estimates for 2014 (HFCS wave 2) and 2017 (HFCS wave 3, current data) are not directly comparable despite using the same register data source. Part of the increase in real estate values is due to change in evaluation approach used.
The value of real asset for HFCS 2014 wave was based on a cadastral value, representing on average 85 of the market value that the real estate had 1.5 years prior to establishing the cadastral value base for a particular year (2012). 
The estimates for HFCS 2017 wave are based on real asset transaction values available for 2016, representing on average 100 of the market value. Therefore the estimates for 2017 (HFCS wave 3"
LV3  Register data were used to edit data on liabilities. Register data could be merged with HFCS data at the personal level.
LV4  For 9.2 of 2014 respondents register data could not be used due lack of personal identification. In 2017 personal identification was available for all respondents.
"LV5  In 2017, the sample prepared for 2014 was used to form a panel component. Weights were corrected to account for changes in addresses, demographics and income structure of population in 2017. 
Unfortunately, despite weight corrections, the use of 2014 sample resulted in underrepresentation of households, who took up mortgages in real estate’s built in 2015-2017 and formed a new household.
"
LV6  The sharp decline in value of self-employed business in 2017, as compared to 2014, could be explained with the classification and data availability issues. Unfortunately in 2017 the information on the employment income if person worked/owned micro enterprise was not available in the State Revenue Service. Thus, only income of people registered as self-employed is accounted for in 2017.
Netherlands
NL1  Compared to the data from wave 2017, the data from waves 2010 and 2014 (waves 1 and 2) are based on smaller samples (ca. 1200 households) and information about assets and liabilities is derived from existing Dutch surveys. Instead, the data from wave 2017 are based on a larger sample (ca. 2500 households) and exactly follows the wording of the HFCN questionnaire. Therefore, the waves 2010 and 2014 may show more sampling uncertainty and differences in the exact wording may have influenced the outcomes as well. Overall, the 2017 wave data are better aligned to the data on household wealth published by Statistics Netherlands.
NL2  The methodology for estimation of voluntary pensions/whole life insurance has been revised, so that the data between wave 2017 and waves 2010/2014 are not fully comparable. In addition, in waves 2010 and 2014 these savings were collected (and imputed) as a whole and not per item separately as in wave 2017.
