### ABSTRACT (NEW)

Despite claims of an emerging "asset economy" and "patrimonial middle class" (Piketty, 2014; Adkins, Cooper, & Konings, 2020), this study uncovers a paradox: households deriving substantial income from assets are declining across Europe. We theorize and empirically analyze "petit-rentier" households—those in a liminal position between wage dependency and capital-based subsistence—to identify who generates significant capital income (CI, comprising rents, dividends, private pensions, and related sources) and why their numbers are shrinking. Using Household Finance and Consumption Survey data from up to 23 EU countries (2011–2021), we apply machine learning feature selection and multilevel modeling to pinpoint determinants of petit-rentier status, defined as households deriving at least 10% of income from non-waged sources. Our findings challenge asset democratization narratives in three respects. First, petit-rentier households declined modestly but significantly EU-wide, despite surging asset values. Second, this masks rising stratification: while most households regressed, employers and multiple-property owners strengthened their positions. Third, real estate beyond primary residences dominates as the key—yet increasingly inaccessible—route to CI generation. These trends indicate that the asset economy fosters inequalities not only between owners and non-owners but among owners themselves. Only select class fractions, particularly employers and those with inherited property, convert assets into income streams. Incorporating private pensions highlights how institutional contexts, such as welfare regime variations, mediate access to petit-rentier status. Ultimately, the asset economy consolidates a narrow elite capable of partial capital-based living, leaving others wage-dependent despite asset ownership.

### NEW INTRO

European societies are experiencing a fundamental tension in contemporary capitalism. While scholars argue we are witnessing the emergence of an "asset economy" where property ownership increasingly determines life chances (Adkins et al., 2021), empirical evidence for the democratization of asset-based income remains contested. Piketty's (2014) influential thesis about the rise of a "patrimonial middle class" suggests that growing numbers of households are transitioning from wage dependence to deriving significant income from capital ownership—becoming "petit-rentiers." Yet this narrative faces a critical challenge: if asset ownership is indeed becoming more widespread and economically significant, why do recent studies suggest that households successfully generating substantial asset-based income may actually be declining rather than expanding (Goldstein & Tian, 2020)? This paradox raises fundamental questions about who benefits from the supposed "democratization" of capital ownership and whether class-based inequalities persist despite apparent asset diffusion.

This study addresses a specific theoretical puzzle emerging from this contradiction: In an era of rising asset prices and expanded access to property ownership, what household characteristics determine successful transition to asset-based income generation, and how do these patterns challenge or confirm theories of class reproduction versus generational mobility? We argue that understanding the demographic composition and evolution of "petit-rentier" households is crucial for evaluating competing claims about whether contemporary capitalism is witnessing genuine social democratization or the persistence of class-based inequalities through new mechanisms. Two competing theoretical perspectives shape this debate. The "generational" perspective, popularized in discussions of "generation rent" versus "generation landlord" (Ronald & Kadi, 2018), suggests that macroeconomic timing—particularly access to property markets before asset price inflation—primarily determines asset-based income capacity. This view implies that age cohorts, rather than traditional class positions, increasingly structure economic opportunities. Conversely, the "class persistence" perspective argues that apparent asset democratization masks underlying continuities in class-based advantages (Christophers, 2018). From this view, those successfully generating asset-based income possess pre-existing advantages—higher wages enabling property accumulation, intergenerational wealth transfers, or employer positions facilitating business ownership—that reproduce traditional class hierarchies through new mechanisms.

Our analysis of EU household data reveals patterns that fundamentally challenge the "asset democratization" narrative while providing nuanced support for class persistence arguments. Contrary to expectations of expanding petit-rentier households, we document a modest but significant decline in such households across most EU countries between 2011-2021. More importantly, successful asset-based income generation concentrates among specific demographic groups—particularly multiple property owners and employer-class households—suggesting that class position, mediated through property ownership, remains the primary determinant of economic success in the supposed "asset economy." Testing these competing theoretical perspectives requires moving beyond aggregate national trends to examine household-level determinants of asset-based income generation. We develop an integrated methodological approach combining machine learning feature importance analysis with multilevel modeling to identify the relative importance of age, class, and asset ownership in predicting petit-rentier status. This approach allows us to assess whether generational timing or class position better explains variation in capital income generation, while accounting for institutional differences across European welfare regimes. Our findings make three theoretical contributions to debates about contemporary capitalism and inequality. First, we provide evidence against the "society of petit-rentiers" thesis, showing that asset-based income generation remains concentrated rather than democratized. Second, we demonstrate that class position—particularly business ownership and multiple property ownership—better predicts capital income success than generational timing alone. Third, we reveal how the shift toward rental income as the dominant form of capital income reflects not democratization but concentration, as successful property acquisition requires existing class advantages that enable multiple property ownership.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next section theoretically contextualizes the dynamics underpinning the social distribution of asset ownership and income and revisits recent debates on the subject. The third section describes our methodology, data sources, and variables. The fourth section presents our empirical analysis and includes a statistical overview of asset-based income at the national level across EU countries followed by the analysis of household-level factors influencing being a petit-rentier, combining feature importance analysis and the estimation of an EU-scale multilevel logistic model. The final section discusses our main findings and their contribution to the literature.
