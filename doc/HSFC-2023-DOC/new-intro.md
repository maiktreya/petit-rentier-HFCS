### ABSTRACT (NEW)

Despite claims of an emerging "asset economy" and "patrimonial middle class" (Piketty, 2014; Adkins, Cooper, & Konings, 2020), this study uncovers a paradox: households deriving substantial income from assets are declining across Europe. We theorize and empirically analyze "petit-rentier" households—those in a liminal position between wage dependency and capital-based subsistence—to identify who generates significant capital income (CI, comprising rents, dividends, private pensions, and related sources) and why their numbers are shrinking. Using Household Finance and Consumption Survey data from up to 23 EU countries (2011–2021), we apply machine learning feature selection and multilevel modeling to pinpoint determinants of petit-rentier status, defined as households deriving at least 10% of income from non-waged sources.

Our findings challenge asset democratization narratives in three respects. First, petit-rentier households declined modestly but significantly EU-wide, despite surging asset values. Second, this masks rising stratification: while most households regressed, employers and multiple-property owners strengthened their positions. Third, real estate beyond primary residences dominates as the key—yet increasingly inaccessible—route to CI generation. These trends indicate that the asset economy fosters inequalities not only between owners and non-owners but among owners themselves. Only select class fractions, particularly employers and those with inherited property, convert assets into income streams. Incorporating private pensions highlights how institutional contexts, such as welfare regime variations, mediate access to petit-rentier status. Ultimately, the asset economy consolidates a narrow elite capable of partial capital-based living, leaving others wage-dependent despite asset ownership.

### NEW INTRODUCTUION

European societies are experiencing a fundamental tension in contemporary capitalism. While scholars argue we are witnessing the emergence of an "asset economy" where property ownership increasingly determines life chances (Adkins et al., 2021), empirical evidence for the democratization of asset-based income remains contested. Piketty's (2014) influential thesis about the rise of a "patrimonial middle class" suggests that growing numbers of households are transitioning from wage dependence to deriving significant income from capital ownership—becoming "petit-rentiers." Yet this narrative faces a critical challenge: if asset ownership is indeed becoming more widespread and economically significant, why do recent studies suggest that households successfully generating substantial asset-based income may actually be declining rather than expanding (Goldstein & Tian, 2020)? This paradox raises fundamental questions about who benefits from the supposed "democratization" of capital ownership and whether class-based inequalities persist despite apparent asset diffusion.

This study addresses a specific theoretical puzzle emerging from this contradiction: In an era of rising asset prices and expanded access to property ownership, what household characteristics determine successful transition to asset-based income generation, and how do these patterns challenge or confirm theories of class reproduction versus generational mobility? We argue that understanding the demographic composition and evolution of "petit-rentier" households is crucial for evaluating competing claims about whether contemporary capitalism is witnessing genuine social democratization or the persistence of class-based inequalities through new mechanisms. Two competing theoretical perspectives shape this debate. The "generational" perspective, popularized in discussions of "generation rent" versus "generation landlord" (Ronald & Kadi, 2018), suggests that macroeconomic timing—particularly access to property markets before asset price inflation—primarily determines asset-based income capacity. This view implies that age cohorts, rather than traditional class positions, increasingly structure economic opportunities. Conversely, the "class persistence" perspective argues that apparent asset democratization masks underlying continuities in class-based advantages (Christophers, 2018). From this view, those successfully generating asset-based income possess pre-existing advantages—higher wages enabling property accumulation, intergenerational wealth transfers, or employer positions facilitating business ownership—that reproduce traditional class hierarchies through new mechanisms.

Our analysis of EU household data reveals patterns that fundamentally challenge the "asset democratization" narrative while providing nuanced support for class persistence arguments. Contrary to expectations of expanding petit-rentier households, we document a modest but significant decline in such households across most EU countries between 2011-2021. More importantly, successful asset-based income generation concentrates among specific demographic groups—particularly multiple property owners and employer-class households—suggesting that class position, mediated through property ownership, remains the primary determinant of economic success in the supposed "asset economy."

Testing these competing theoretical perspectives requires moving beyond aggregate national trends to examine household-level determinants of asset-based income generation. We develop an integrated methodological approach combining machine learning feature importance analysis with multilevel modeling to identify the relative importance of age, class, and asset ownership in predicting petit-rentier status. This approach allows us to assess whether generational timing or class position better explains variation in capital income generation, while accounting for institutional differences across European welfare regimes. Our findings make three theoretical contributions to debates about contemporary capitalism and inequality. First, we provide evidence against the "society of petit-rentiers" thesis, showing that asset-based income generation remains concentrated rather than democratized. Second, we demonstrate that class position—particularly business ownership and multiple property ownership—better predicts capital income success than generational timing alone. Third, we reveal how the shift toward rental income as the dominant form of capital income reflects not democratization but concentration, as successful property acquisition requires existing class advantages that enable multiple property ownership.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next section theoretically contextualizes the dynamics underpinning the social distribution of asset ownership and income and revisits recent debates on the subject. The third section describes our methodology, data sources, and variables. The fourth section presents our empirical analysis and includes a statistical overview of asset-based income at the national level across EU countries followed by the analysis of household-level factors influencing being a petit-rentier, combining feature importance analysis and the estimation of an EU-scale multilevel logistic model. The final section discusses our main findings and their contribution to the literature.

**3.3 Identifying Key Predictors: A Machine Learning Approach**

Before conducting our main statistical analysis, we face a common challenge in survey research: selecting which variables to include from a large collection of household characteristics. Traditional approaches rely on researcher judgment and selective literature reviews, inadvertently opening the door to bias where researchers might unconsciously choose variables that confirm their expectations. To address this, we employ a machine learning technique called gradient boosting—essentially, an algorithm that learns which household characteristics best predict petit-rentier status by testing thousands of variable combinations. Think of it as systematically asking: "Of all possible household features—age, education, wealth, occupation, location—which actually matter most for distinguishing households with significant capital income?"

The algorithm produces an "importance score" for each characteristic, ranking them by predictive power without requiring assumptions about their relationship to our outcome. These scores, collectively reported as an "importance matrix," sum to 100%—showing each variable's proportional contribution to prediction. The matrix might reveal, for instance, that owning secondary property matters more than total wealth, or that certain occupations are surprisingly predictive—patterns we might miss if we only tested pre-selected variables based on existing theory.

Crucially, this machine learning step doesn't replace traditional statistical analysis; it identifies which variables merit inclusion in our multilevel models (Section 3.4), where we properly estimate effect sizes, test statistical significance, and examine cross-country variations. This two-stage approach represents a promising methodological innovation for sociology in an era of increasingly rich survey data: as datasets grow more comprehensive, machine learning offers principled ways to navigate complexity without sacrificing the interpretability and theoretical grounding that define sociological inquiry. Rather than viewing computational methods as alternatives to traditional analysis, we demonstrate how they serve as powerful preliminary tools that enhance the inferential frameworks social scientists rely upon.

## C) NOTES ON PETIT RENTIERS AS SOCIAL CLASS
(a mi me aclara pensarlo asi, a lo mejor te sirve para lo que me mandaste que hay que cambiar en lo teórico)

---

Our conceptualization of 'petit-rentier' households requires careful theoretical positioning, particularly given its resonance with the classical Marxist category of 'petite bourgeoisie.' Like the petite bourgeoisie—small business owners caught between capital and labor—petit-rentiers occupy a liminal class position characterized by internal contradictions and structural vulnerabilities. However, while the classical petite bourgeoisie was defined by ownership of small-scale means of production, petit-rentiers are distinguished by their mode of capital income realization: they remain confined to household-based asset returns rather than corporate-structured accumulation. This distinction reflects a fundamental feature of contemporary stratification that our household survey data uniquely captures. We assume—based on established tax optimization literature and regulatory incentives across EU countries—that truly large capital owners increasingly channel returns through corporate vehicles, trusts, and holding companies that separate capital gains from personal income flows. This leaves household surveys capturing a specific fraction: those with sufficient assets to generate meaningful returns (our >10% threshold) but below the scale where corporate structuring becomes advantageous or necessary.

This apparent methodological limitation thus becomes a theoretical virtue, allowing us to examine what might be called the 'asymptotic behavior' at the boundaries of class positions. Just as the classical petite bourgeoisie revealed the contradictions of capital ownership without capital power, our petit-rentiers illuminate the limits of asset-based welfare in contemporary Europe. They possess enough capital to partially escape wage dependency but not enough to access the fiscal and legal instruments of genuine capital accumulation. This makes them uniquely vulnerable to market fluctuations, tax policy changes, and institutional shifts that large capital owners can navigate through corporate restructuring. Moreover, like Marx's petite bourgeoisie, petit-rentiers exhibit distinctive intra-group heterogeneity—ranging from elderly households living on accumulated savings to small landlords managing rental properties to SME owners straddling household and business domains—that makes them worthy of analysis despite, or perhaps because of, their transitional position in the class structure. Understanding this fraction is crucial not for what it tells us about capital's commanding heights, but for what it reveals about the actually existing limits of asset democratization and the emerging fault lines within the propertied middle classes.
