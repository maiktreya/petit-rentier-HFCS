General notes		
        
"All statistics in this document are calculated using the final estimation weights, which ensure that the figures are representative of the population. 
Within each country, the sum of estimation weights equals the total number of households in the country, so that the sum of weights in the whole dataset equals the total number of households in the countries participating in the survey. 
The euro area results correspond to the 19 euro area countries participating in the survey."		
"The document “The Household Finance and Consumption Survey – Methodological Report for the 2021 wave” provides a detailed overview of the main methodological features of the survey. 
That report describes the survey mode, fieldwork, the questionnaire, the sample design, the unit and item nonresponse and weighting, multiple estimation, variance estimation, statistical disclosure control, and comparability issues of the HFCS."		
"In the interpretation of results it should be kept in mind that the reference years of the country surveys vary between 2019 and 2021, as indicated in the table of reference periods available on the following pages. 
The differences in reference years can be particularly relevant for the values of financial and real assets.."		
Percentage shares may not sum to 100 because of rounding.		
• <0.1 stands for a value that is between -0.05 and 0.05.		
"• M stands for a missing value – item was not collected in a given country or comparable information is not available in the HFCS database.  
."		
• N stands for “not calculated” because less than 25 observations are available.		
        
Standard errors, displayed in brackets with a grey font, were calculated with the Rao-Wu rescaled bootstrap method using replicate weights provided by the countries (1000 replicates; see the HFCS Methodological Report for details), and take into account the fact that the data are multiply imputed.		
        
        
Definitions		
        
Household reference person		
        
The household reference person is chosen according to the international standards of the so-called Canberra Group (UNECE 2011), which uses the following sequential steps to determine a unique reference person in the household:		
• household type [determined by a one of the partners in a registered or de facto marriage, with dependent children, b) one of the partners in a registered or de facto marriage, without dependent children, and c) a lone parent with dependent children],		
• the person with the highest income,		
• the eldest person.		
        
Net wealth and its main components		
        
Net wealth is defined as the difference between total (gross) assets and total liabilities. Total assets consist of real assets and financial assets.		
        
Real assets include:		
• value of the household main residence (for owners)		
• value of other real estate property		
• value of vehicles (cars and other vehicles, such as boats, planes or motorbikes)		
• value of valuables		
• value of self-employment businesses of household members.		
        
Financial assets consist of:		
• deposits (sight accounts, saving accounts)		
• investments in mutual funds		
• bonds		
• investments held in non-self-employment private businesses		
• publicly traded shares		
• managed investment accounts		
• money owed to households as private loans		
• other financial assets: options, futures, index certificates, precious metals, oil and gas leases, future proceeds from a lawsuit or estate that is being settled, royalties or any other.		
• private pension plans and whole life insurance policies.		
Current value of public and occupational pension plans is not included.		
        
Total liabilities (debt) consist of:		
• outstanding amount of household main residence mortgages and other real estate property mortgages		
• outstanding amount of debt on credit cards and credit lines/bank overdrafts		
• outstanding amounts of other, non-collateralised, loans (including loans from commercial providers and private loans).		
        
Household income		
        
Household income is measured as gross income and is defined as the sum of labour and non-labour income for all household members. Labour income is collected for all household members aged 16 and older, other income sources are collected at the household level. In some countries, as gross income is not well known by respondents it is computed from the net income given by the respondent.		
Specifically, the measure for gross income includes the following components: employee income, self-employment income, income from pensions, regular social transfers, regular private transfers, income from real estate property (income received from renting a property or land after deducting costs such as mortgage interest repayments, minor repairs, maintenance, insurance and other charges), income from financial investments (interest and dividends received from publicly traded companies and the amount of interest from assets such as bank accounts, certificates of deposit, bonds, publicly traded shares etc. received during the income reference period less expenses incurred), income from private business and partnerships and other non-specified sources of income. See section 9.2.4 of the Methodological Report on details on the collection of income variables in various countries.		
        
Indicators of debt burden, financial fragility and credit constraints		
        
Debt-asset ratio: ratio of total liabilities to total gross assets. Defined for indebted households.		
        
Debt-income ratio: ratio of total liabilities and total gross household income. Defined for indebted households.		
        
Debt service-income ratio: ratio of total monthly debt payments to household gross monthly income.		
Payments for household’s total debt are the monthly payments (or the monthly equivalent of other time frequency payments) of the household to the lender to repay the loan. They include interest and repayment but exclude any required payments for taxes, insurance and other fees. The household’s total payments include the payments for mortgages and the payments for other loans, such as car loans, consumer and instalment loans and loans from relatives, friends, employers etc.		
Debt service-income ratio can be calculated for all indebted households, or only for indebted households excluding those having only credit line, overdrafts or credit card debt.		
For bullet loans, all payments are due at the end of the loan term. For these loans, repayments are zero.		
        
Mortgage debt service-income ratio: ratio of total monthly mortgage debt payments (i.e., payments made to repay all mortgages, for the HMR and other properties) to household gross monthly income. Defined for households with mortgage debt.		
        
Loan-Value ratio of HMR: ratio of outstanding amount of HMR mortgage to current value of the HMR. Defined for households with HMR mortgage debt.		
        
Net liquid assets to income: ratio of net liquid assets to household gross annual income. Net liquid assets are calculated as the sum of value of deposits, mutual funds, bonds, non-self-employment business wealth, (publicly traded) shares and managed accounts, net of credit line/overdraft debt, credit card debt and other non-mortgage debt. Defined for all households.		
        
Credit constrained household: household who applied for credit and was turned down and do not report successful later reapplication, or those who applied for credit but were not given as much as they applied for or those who did not apply for credit due to a perceived credit constraint.)
