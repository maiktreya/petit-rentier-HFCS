üìñ HFCS Mixed Logit with K-gains ‚Äî Pipeline Help

This pipeline implements two workflows:

1. Quick pooled model ‚Üí fast, reproducible estimation of a mixed logit across multiply imputed HFCS data, with Rubin-pooled coefficients and AMEs.


2. Full diagnostics suite ‚Üí robustness tests to detect whether including capital gains (K-gains) in the definition of capital income biases the model or simply rescales effects.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Pooled Runner

Goal: Fit the model once per imputed dataset, pool results with Rubin‚Äôs rules, and report interpretable quantities.

Outputs:

Pooled fixed effects (coefficients + SEs).

Pooled average marginal effects (AMEs) for key covariates.

Pooled random-effects / ICC summary.



> ‚úÖ Use this for fast iteration and headline replication.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Full Diagnostics Suite

The full diagnostics pipeline expands the analysis to check robustness and potential bias channels.

Step 2.1 ‚Äî Baseline vs K-inclusive vs Trimmed models

Baseline model: Capital income (CI) excludes K-gains; no hasKgains regressor.

K-inclusive model: CI includes K-gains; hasKgains enters as a binary regressor.

Trimmed K-gains model: Same as above, but K-gains winsorized at the 99th percentile.


Purpose: Compare effect sizes across specifications. If including K-gains changes the magnitude/sign of other covariates, that suggests bias or instability.


---

Step 2.2 ‚Äî Average Marginal Effects (AMEs) & Œî-AME

AME: Average change in predicted probability of being a petit-rentier when a covariate changes.

Œî-AME: Percent change in AME between baseline and K-inclusive.


Purpose: Measures whether adding K-gains pervasively shifts the substantive meaning of key predictors (e.g., property ownership, class).


---

Step 2.3 ‚Äî Random Effects & ICC comparison

Extract random-effects variances for country and country√ówave, plus ICC.

Compute Spearman correlation of country BLUPs between baseline and K-inclusive.


Purpose: Checks whether K-gains are absorbing contextual variation.

If ICC drops or country ranks reshuffle (œÅ < 0.85), K-gains may be proxying for unobserved macro shocks (bias risk).



---

Step 2.4 ‚Äî Mundlak Decomposition

Decompose hasKgains into:

Cluster mean (between effect, country√ówave average).

Within deviation (household-level departure).



Purpose: Tests whether the K-gains effect is mainly contextual (macro shock) or within-cluster (idiosyncratic).

A large between effect suggests K-gains are picking up country-wave shocks ‚Üí possible omitted macro bias.



---

Step 2.5 ‚Äî Threshold Sweep

Re-estimate models at CI share thresholds {5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%}.

Compute AMEs for key variables at each threshold.


Purpose: Ensures conclusions are not an artifact of the 10% cutoff.

Robust findings should hold across thresholds.

Instability across thresholds signals fragility of the petit-rentier definition when K-gains are included.



---

Step 2.6 ‚Äî Trimmed K-gains Sensitivity

Refit models with K-gains top-coded at the 99th percentile (P99).


Purpose: Tests whether results are driven by extreme, lumpy realizations of K-gains.

Stable AMEs after trimming ‚Üí results not tail-driven.

Big shifts ‚Üí sensitivity to outliers, interpret cautiously.



---

Step 2.7 ‚Äî Leave-One-Out (LOO) Influence

Refit models leaving out one country at a time and one wave at a time.

Compare AMEs with full-sample AMEs.


Purpose: Detects whether results are disproportionately driven by a single country or wave.

If max Œî-AME > 25% or sign flips ‚Üí evidence of leverage, not generalizable.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation Guide

Small Œî-AMEs (< 15%) + stable REs (œÅ > 0.85, ŒîICC < 0.03): Inclusion of K-gains mainly rescales income; no pervasive bias.

Large Œî-AMEs, ICC drop, or RE rank reshuffle: K-gains are absorbing macro variation ‚Üí risk of biased inference.

Threshold sweep stable: Results robust to definition choice.

Trimmed vs untrimmed similar: Results not tail-driven.

LOO stable: Results generalizable across EU sample.

üîë Key takeaway

The pipeline distinguishes between:

Benign rescaling (K-gains change variance structure but not substantive effects).

Pervasive bias (K-gains alter other coefficients, ICC, or contextual effects).


This helps decide whether to include K-gains in the operational definition of capital income for petit-rentier analysis.
